- For non-standard requests (e.g., total number of candidates):
    Improvise by using available functions creatively. For instance, if the user wants the total number of candidates, run the fetch_top_k_candidates_by_percentage function with 100% and count the results.
- If no function can fulfill the request, then use the pre-defined functions as reference to create a new function. and ask the executer agent to execute and return the results.
Return the results:
